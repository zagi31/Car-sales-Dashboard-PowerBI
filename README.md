The Car Sales dashboard was created for educational and recruitment purposes, as a presentation of skills in data modeling, creating dynamic visualizations, and designing user-friendly interfaces in Power BI.

ðŸ§© Stage 1: Data Modeling

Data import and cleaning: Preparing raw data, removing duplicates and invalid values.
Creating a calendar table and connecting it to the sales table based on date.
Relationship management: defining the proper relationships between tables (1:*), setting directional filters.

ðŸ“Š Stage 2: Data Visualizations & Interactivity
Created DAX measures (KPIs), including:
Aggregate: SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE
Conditional: IF, SWITCH
Time Intelligence: TOTALYTD, TOTALMTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATEADD
Advanced: CALCULATE, ALLSELECTED, MAXX, FORMAT, CONCATENATE
General View page includes:
YTD Sales map by dealer region (map chart)
Donut charts: YTD Sales by car color and body style
Matrix showing producer results â€“ average price, volume, % share
Area chart with weekly YTD Sales trend (maximum point highlighted)
Details View page: full-detail table with data for each sold vehicle (VIN, make, body type, price, etc.)
Interactive elements added:
Dropdown filters (Body Style, Dealer Name, Transmission, Engine)
Navigation button to switch between pages

ðŸ§  Stage 3: User Experience & Design
Layout: Split interface - visual section (black textured background) and filtering/navigation section (slightly brighter right-side panel)
Visual optimization: conditional formatting, clear labels and well-chosen color palette for charts, chart scaling (e.g., value axes) and rounded values for clarity
Responsiveness & clarity:
Intuitive navigation and logical arrangement of components
Use of contrast and highlighting for active interface elements
